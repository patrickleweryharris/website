description: Don't put SIM Cards in junk mail.

Every few months, I get a promotion in the mail from Virgin Plus, a Canadian
Telecom provider. They
desperately want me to use them for my mobile phone. So much so that every
few months, they send me a SIM Card in the mail, that I can throw
in my phone to instantly become a customer. Convenient right?

Well, I suppose it would be convenient if I actually wanted their service.
But I didn't request a SIM Card from them, and now this little
integrated circuit is going in the garbage with all the rest of my junk mail.

Junk mail in general is already an environmental problem, producing millions
of tons of garbage needlessly. The average American receives 41 pounds of it
each year, and 44% goes unopened, according to this [2019 article
from Juhea Kim at the Sierra Club][sierra].

Adding a SIM Card just adds insult to injury. Now, instead of just some paper
that can hopefully be recycled, Virgin Plus is sending me E-Waste every few
months. Repeatedly sending a piece of electronics to people
who aren't even your customers is just plain wasteful. It shows that the company doesn't care about
even making a token gesture to reduce its environmental impact. All that
matters is money.
