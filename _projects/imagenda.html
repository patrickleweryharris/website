    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Imagenda is a mobile application to scan a real-life schedule and digitize it.
        Using the app, the user takes a photo of a schedule on paper or
        uploads a screenshot from a webpage. Events from the image are
        instantly recognized, processed, and imported into their
        preferred calendar application (e.g. Google Calendar or iCal).
        In bustling conferences or meetings, schedules are often distributed
        in the form of brochures or websites that have arbitrary formats.
        This application allows users to import any third-party schedule
        to their personal e-calendar with ease.
